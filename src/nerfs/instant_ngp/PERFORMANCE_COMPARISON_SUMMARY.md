# Performance Comparison Results Summary

## Test Environment
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti
- **Compute Capability**: 6.1
- **CUDA Memory**: 10.9 GB

## Performance Results

### Spherical Harmonics Encoding
- **Original is 1.5-3x FASTER** than optimized version
- Original achieves up to 1.15B samples/sec vs 382M samples/sec for optimized

### Hash Encoding  
- **Mixed results**: Optimized is 18% faster for small workloads (1K samples)
- Similar performance for larger workloads

## Key Findings

1. **Original implementation is already well-optimized** for GTX 1080 Ti
2. **"Advanced" optimizations can hurt performance** on older architectures
3. **Simple code sometimes performs better** than complex optimized code
4. **Memory bandwidth is often the limiting factor** on GTX 1080 Ti

## Recommendations

**For GTX 1080 Ti users**: Use the **original implementation** - it's faster and simpler.

**For optimization work**: Always profile baseline performance before optimizing.

## Technical Lesson

This demonstrates that **more complex â‰  faster**. The original Instant NGP implementation was already well-tuned for GTX 1080 Ti hardware. Additional "optimizations" using advanced CUDA techniques actually degraded performance in most cases.

The key takeaway: **understand your target hardware and profile before optimizing**.
